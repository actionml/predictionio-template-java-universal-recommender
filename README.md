# The Universal Recommender - Java

The Universal Recommender (UR) is a new type of collaborative filtering recommender based on an algorithm that can use data from a wide variety of user taste indicators&mdash;it is called the Correlated Cross-Occurrence algorithm. Unlike  matrix factorization embodied in things like MLlib's ALS, CCO is able to ingest any number of user actions, events, profile data, and contextual information. It then serves results in a fast and scalable way. It also supports item properties for filtering and boosting recommendations and can therefor be considered a hybrid collaborative filtering and content-based recommender.

The use of multiple **types** of data fundamentally changes the way a recommender is used and, when employed correctly, will provide a significant increase in quality of recommendations vs. using only one user event. Most recommenders, for instance, can only use "purchase" events. Using all we know about a user and their context allows us to much better predict their preferences.
